## How to Contribute

The `develop` branch contains the latest code. To contribute effectively, follow these steps:

1. Start by creating a detailed issue on GitHub, and assign it to Shridhars TL. This practice ensures a smooth transition when you create a pull request.
2. Maintain a universal approach â€“ your changes should be browser-agnostic and beneficial for all users. Avoid implementing features tailored to specific needs.
